				I design and build full stack applications using technologies such as
				JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, Django, MongoDB, and
				PostgreSQL. I'm a curious programmer who loves to reverse-engineer code
				to develop a deeper understanding on how and why it works. I'm seeking a
				successful career with a company that will utilize my strong-problem
				solving, analytical, and creative thinking skill-set.
